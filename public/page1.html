      <p><b>Entertainment:</b>
      <br>For people who have been living on land for a long time, the ocean is a
      <br>completely different and mysterious world. These fascinating marine 
      <br>creatures inspire visitors to explore and bring them a novel and 
      <br>delightful experience. Visitors will bring their families to the aquarium in 
      <br>their free time to observe the forms and behaviors of marine creatures 
      <br>and better understand these amazing creatures.It's like an open encyclopedia that brings
      <br>great educational significance.
      <br>
      <br><b>Eornamental:</b>
      <br>There are many kinds of marine creatures with different forms, which bring 
      <br>great visual impact to the visitors. The colors are vibrant and beautiful 
      <br>and the interaction between the creatures is wonderful. As they live in 
      <br>the ocean, they move in a myriad of different ways, much different from 
      <br>creatures on land.
