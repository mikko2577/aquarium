      <p>The sea hare is a fascinating marine gastropod mollusk known for its 
      <br>distinctive, rabbit-like appearance. These soft-bodied creatures, 
      <br>belonging to the Aplysiidae family, can be found in shallow coastal 
      <br>waters around the world. Sea hares are herbivorous, primarily feeding 
      <br>on algae, which they graze using a specialized radula. Their bodies are 
      <br>typically adorned with vibrant colors and patterns, serving as a defense 
      <br>mechanism to deter predators. Remarkably, sea hares can release a
      <br>cloud of purple ink when threatened, further enhancing their ability to 
      <br>escape. These unique marine animals play a vital role in their 
      <br>ecosystems by controlling algal growth and providing a food source for 
      <br>other marine species. Their intriguing behaviors and striking 
      <br>appearances make sea hares a popular subject of study in marine 
      <br>biology, offering valuable insights into the adaptability and survival 
      <br>strategies of mollusks in diverse marine environments.
